Wet Grain is an annual print magazine for new poetry in English. Its most recent issue (July 2024), guest-edited by Leo Boix & Nat Teitler FRSL, spotlighted the work of Latinx poets living in the UK. It also featured work in translation from across Latin America.

Since 2020, the magazine has included the work of emerging poets alongside recipients of awards including the Pulitzer, a MacArthur Fellowship, the Pushcart Prize, the German Book Prize, and the Eric Gregory.

Each issue, selected poets are invited to contribute a short piece of commentary on a poem included in the issue. As of Issue Five, we also publish interviews and flash essays. Covers feature commissioned etchings and are hand-printed, making each copy an original print.

Submissions are open for Issue Six, guest-edited by Nasim Luczaj, Eloise Birtwhistle, & Charles Lang, until the 4th April 2025 (see our submission guidelines here)
