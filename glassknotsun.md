In the face of widespread disconnection and environmental decay, 
McCafferty’s Glass Knot Sun remains full of hope. Charged with metaphors 
that capture tiny marvels such as ‘the honey / of a summer thought’ 
and ‘sudden islands in the sound of milk’, and displaying a poetics 
that is tender and immersive, inquisitive and wise, the poems display 
a playful reverence for the natural world, capturing its timeless 
vitality and transformative power - Isabelle Baafi
