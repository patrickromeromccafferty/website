a night of ambient music and poetry hosted at King Tut’s, Scotland’s leading independent music venue
that invites poets to perform with substantial musical backing and on the same bill as practitioners 
in both popular and experimental forms of music. Between April 2023 and June 2024, we worked with the likes of Sean Wai Keung, Ellen Renton, Juana Adcock, Nasim Rebecca Asl, 
Tawona Sithole, and Charles Lang, with special events at Connect Festival and Paisley Book Fest.
