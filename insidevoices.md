Inside Voices is a night of ambient music and poetry hosted by King Tut’s, Scotland’s leading independent music venue. 
The monthly event showcases work by emerging poets from around Scotland to a music-going audience, inviting poets to perform 
with substantial musical backing and on the same bill as practitioners in both popular and experimental forms of music. 
Between April 2023 and June 2024, we worked with the likes of Sean Wai Keung, Ellen Renton, Juana Adcock, Nasim Rebecca Asl, 
Tawona Sithole, and Charles Lang, with special events at Connect Festival and Paisley Book Fest.
